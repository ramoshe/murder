## WARNING: Don't explore this section before the event!

The pages in section contain the scenario for each round (which is read aloud by the host at the beginning of the round) along with the secret clues, which **should not be revealed until you are instructed by the game leader to reveal them.**

If you are playing along with the game, you can open each page only at the start of that round, then one of the characters will reveal the secret clue for each round. At that point you can click and see the clue for yourself.
